# NLP-POS-Tagging-and-Named-Entity-Recognition
This project implements a statistical Part-of-Speech tagger using a Hidden Markov Model with Viterbi decoding and performs Named Entity Recognition using the Stanford NER tagger. The system is trained and evaluated on the NLTK Treebank corpus and applied to real-world movie summaries.
